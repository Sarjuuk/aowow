Massive doors of rock protect the city in times of war, and lava from the mountain itself is redirected and distributed for heat, energy and smithing purposes. Before the Dark Iron Clan was banished from the city, eventually leading to the War of the Three Hammers, Ironforge was the commercial and social center of all the dwarven clans. It is now home to the Bronzebeard Clan. Many dwarven strongholds fell during the Second War between the Horde and the Alliance of Lordaeron, but the mighty city of Ironforge, nestled in the wintry peaks of [zone=1] and protected by its great gates, was never breached by the invading Horde.\n\nRelatively recently, Ironforge also became home to the Gnomeregan refugees. After the Third War, the gnomish city of Gnomeregan became overrun by troggs.

Perenolde believed that a Horde victory was inevitable, and thus offered aid to the Horde by stirring up rebellions, attacking Alliance bases, and giving them supplies. When this treachery was discovered, the Alliance marched on Alterac and destroyed it. Perenolde and any nobles who went along with his plans were stripped of their titles and land. Many of the nobility managed to escape, however, and began plotting their revenge. Using their still sizable fortunes, the nobility hired a band of thieves and assassins, forming an organization known as the Syndicate.\n\nAt first the Syndicate\'s goal was just to spread chaos and disorder, striking from hidden bases in the Alterac Mountains. With the end of the Third War and the resultant chaos however, the leaders of the Syndicate saw their chance to return Alterac to its former power. They have now gained control of several outposts in the surrounding area including the sacked fortress of Durnholde Keep and a portion of the city of Stromgarde.\n\nThey are enemies of both the Alliance, whom they consider their mortal enemies, and the Horde, whom they consider mere brutes good for nothing but slave labor.

Now, at the end of the Third War, in the renamed Kingdom of Stormwind, it stands as one of the last bastions of human power left in the world. \n\nWith the fall of the northern kingdoms, Stormwind is by far the most populated city in the world.

At first it may seem a simple task as the guards don\'t appear as threatening as the other monsters a player faces within the game. However, the guards are highly equipped to neutralize players of any class, to prevent people from attacking each other while in the town. What gives the Booty Bay Bruiser the advantage is several factors, one of them being their ability to use nets to lock you in place, preventing you from escaping. Another is the fact that they spawn every time you attack a citizen of the city or if you’re under Unfriendly status with Booty Bay the Bruisers can spawn if you enter a building, because of this players can soon find them selves swarmed by Bruisers.\n\nYet, theses are just the minor problems, in comparison to the Bruiser’s strongest ability, once it pulls out its gun its unlikely you will live, if you do not escape fast enough. Each time a guard shoots you, the attack throws you back, much like an Ogre hammer attack; the difference here is that the Bruiser can shoot in quick succession causing chain throw backs. A player can literally be thrown from one side of the town to the other, preventing you from attacking. More often you will find your self being forced into a corner, unable to move and unable to attack with each spell being interrupted by the Bruiser’s attack. Because the Bruisers do not put their guns away once they are out, the best course of action is to run away. \n\nThrough trial and error most people have discovered a safe place to kill Booty Bay Bruisers. If you follow the tunnel leading into the town, the path to your left that leads to the Blacksmith house is the ideal place to kill the guards. Only two guards patrol this path and normally don’t pass each other that closely, allowing both to be dispatched separately. Once they are gone, one can simply enter the first build on the path to cause a guard to spawn if they are below Unfriendly, if not they can simply attack one of the two NPC in the build, both of which are not high in level. Doing this a player should be able to kill 2 to 4 Bruisers before the two patrolling Bruisers re-spawn. On average a player doing this can kill about 30 to 40 Booty Bay Bruisers gaining about 800 reputation points with the pirates. The Bruisers here don’t appear to pull out their guns, but if you find your self in a bad situation, you can jump over the railing running along the path to the waters below, to escape.\n\n[h3]Rewards[/h3]\nBecoming friendly with the Bloodsail Buccaneers will grant you access to the following items:\n\n[ul]\n[li][item=12185] - Summons a [npc=11236][/li]\n[li][item=22742][/li]\n[li][item=22743][/li]\n[li][item=22745][/li]\n[/ul]\n\nYou will need Honored with the Bloodsail Buccaneers for [achievement=2336].'),(8,92,0,NULL,0,2,'[b]Gelkis[/b] are a tribe of centaur who have made their home in the southmost parts of [zone=405].

They existed for thousands of years until the coming of the Night Elves, who warred with them and eventually drove both empires into exile. \n\nFollowing the Great Sundering, the defeated Gurubashi grew ever more desperate to eke out a living. Searching for a means to survive, they enlisted the aid of the savage [npc=14834], also known as the Soulflayer. Hakkar grew into a merciless oppressor who demanded daily sacrifices from his devotees, and so in time the Gurubashi turned on their dark master. The strongest tribes (including the Zandalar) banded together to defeat Hakkar and his loyal troll priests, the Atal\'ai. The united tribes narrowly defeated the Blood God and cast out the Atal\'ai... despite their victory, however, the Gurubashi Empire soon fell. \n\nIn recent years the exiled Atal\'ai priests have discovered that Hakkar\'s physical form can only be summoned within the ancient and once-deserted capital of the Gurubashi Empire, Zul\'Gurub.

The Goblins believe in profit above loyalty, thus Gadgetzan is considered neutral territory in the Horde/Alliance conflict.\n\n[h3]History[/h3]\nAlthough the goblins\' neutrality is almost universally acknowledged, there are still those who seek to sow chaos and anarchy. For Gadgetzan, this comes in the form of the Wastewander bandits, a gang of miscreants who have occupied the Waterspring Field and Noonshade Ruins of northeast Tanaris. Few goblins care about ancient ruins (unless they have treasure) – for all they care, the bandits can have the old blocks of stone. \n\nHowever, the Waterspring Field is vital to the goblins\' survival in the desert, providing them with the liquid gold of the desert. Water towers out in the field were constructed under the blazing heat of the desert sun by the backbreaking work of their slaves, and by Az, the goblins aren\'t going to give up their hard earned towers that easily. However, the Bruisers need to stay in town to keep the gnomes\' collective Napoleonic-complex from getting out of hand and to stop the seemingly endless dueling among the various visitors from disrupting business.

It is a city of entertainment and trade, where anything that anyone would ever want to buy — and plenty of things that no one ever wants to buy — is on sale.\n\nRatchet is currently run by a corporate group known as the Steamwheedle Cartel a splinter group from the Venture Company, who first built the port town for trading with [zone=1637]. It is initially a neutral faction to both Horde and Alliance. A ferry conveniently connects Ratchet to Booty Bay.\n\n[h3]History[/h3]\nBuilt from equal parts of industry and decadence, the goblin port city of Ratchet sprawls along nearly a mile of of coastline where the eastern Barrens poke between [zone=14] and the [zone=15] to the sea. Ratchet is the pride of the goblins, a trade city where you can find almost anything your heart desires - and if something is not in stock, you can bet the goblins can order it. Ratchet also had regular ferries that traversed the safe though roundabout route to the island stronghold of Theramore to the south.\n\nRatchet is a city where creatures who were once the butt of jokes now reign supreme. Its streets wander without rhyme or reason through neighborhoods dedicated to one activity: commerce. Ramshackle warehouses stand next to stately stone homes. Fine shops press cheek to jowl with rude huts. Wares of every type imaginable - and some beyond the imagination - are on display in markets and in exclusive boutiques.\n\nGoblins welcome anyone with gold or items of value and a willingness to trade them for their wares and services. Merchants throng the marketplaces each day, selling everything from silks to slaves, and even at night the stores lining the twisting streets and alleys remain open for business. Those with the money can listen to skilled musicians while drinking fine ales and eating food prepared by expert chefs. For those with earthier tastes, the streets along the wharf teem with whorehouses, taprooms, and casinos.\n\nRatchet is the largest port on Kalimdor, with as many ships bringing cargo in as there are ships heading out for other sites around Kalimdor. In addition to legitimate trade vessels, pirate craft receive amnesty while in the port of Ratchet as long as they can pay the stiff docking fees. This situation makes many merchant captains furious, but they cannot hope to stay in business if they boycott Ratchet. Moreover, the Lawkeepers and hired mercenaries prowling the waterfront are eager to deal with anyone looking to cause trouble.\n\n[h3]Reputation[/h3]\nMost of the quests to raise reputation with Ratchet and the Steamwheedle Cartel are located in the Barrens.

The Wildhammer Clan was unsuccessful in wresting control of [zone=1537] from the Bronzebeard and Dark Iron clans. Khardros and his Wildhammer warriors traveled north through the barrier gates of Dun Algaz, and founded their own kingdom within the distant peak of Grim Batol. There, the Wildhammers thrived and rebuilt their stores of treasure.\n\n[npc=9019] and his Dark Irons vowed revenge against Ironforge. Thaurissan and his sorceress wife, Modgud, launched a two-pronged assault against both Ironforge and Grim Batol. As Modgud confronted the enemy warriors, she used her powers to strike fear into their hearts. Shadows moved at her command, and dark things crawled up from the depths of the earth to stalk the Wildhammers in their own halls. Eventually Modgud broke through the gates and laid siege to the fortress itself. The Wildhammers fought desperately, Khardros himself wading through the roiling masses to slay the sorceress queen. With their queen lost, the Dark Irons fled before the fury of the Wildhammers.\n\nOnce the immediate Dark Iron threat was eliminated, the Wildhammers returned home to Grim Batol. However, the death of the Modgud had left an evil stain on the mountain fortress, and the Wildhammers found it uninhabitable. Khardros took his people north towards the lands of Lordaeron. Settling within the mountainous region of the Aerie Peaks and The Hinterlands, and lush forests of Northeron, the Wildhammers crafted the city of Aerie Peak, where the Wildhammers grew closer to nature and even bonded with the mighty gryphons of the area. Over time they started calling their land the Hinterlands. \n\n[b]Modern Wildhammers[/b]\nThe Wildhammer Clan currently makes its home at Aerie Peak in the Hinterlands. The most immediate threat to their security comes from the east in the form of the Witherbark Trolls and Vilebranch Trolls.

The gains row calculates the minimum values of all stats that appear in any group in the item comparison. It then displays the bonuses each row has [b]above[/b] this minimum.\r\n\r\nFor example, the minimum stamina for any group in [url=/?compare=35031;35030;35029;35028;35027]this comparison[/url] is 50. The gains row displays nothing for the items which have 50 stamina, +23 sta for the item with 73 stamina, and +27 sta for the items with 77 stamina.\r\n\r\nBasically, the gains row removes the shared stats between all groups so that you can focus on what each group brings to the table.\r\n\r\n[h3]Focus Group[/h3]\r\n\r\n[screenshot url=STATIC_URL/images/help/item-comparison/focus2.gif thumb=STATIC_URL/images/help/item-comparison/focus.gif float=right]Comparing arena sets of the first four PvP\r\nseasons using a focus group.[/screenshot]Setting a focus group is done by clicking on the eye icon in the group\'s control bar.

Just [url=/?aboutus#contact]contact us[/url], or post on our [url=/?forums&board=1]forums[/url]! \r\n\r\n[pad]\r\n\r\n[tabs name=weights]\r\n\r\n[tab name=FAQ]\r\n\r\n[h3]How do weights work?[/h3]\r\nThe weighting system allows you to give a weight value to attributes that matter to you and applies your ratings to items in your search results. Each weight value is multiplied by an item\'s stat points and then added together to get the item\'s total score. This score is used to sort the results and display the highest scoring items.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that spell damage is worth twice as much as spell crit, you could add the weights as 2 and 1, 100 and 50, or any other numbers with the same ratio.\r\n\r\nPlease note that weights only work for [url=/?items=4]Armor[/url], [url=/?items=2]Weapons[/url], [url=/?items=3]Gems[/url] and [url=/?items=0]Consumables[/url]. \r\n[h3]What is the difference between weights and equivalency?[/h3]\r\nThe equivalency of two attributes describes how much one equals the other. You may find equivalency ratings that say something like 1 agility = 1.5 strength. This is [b]not[/b] the same as weight values; in fact, it\'s the exact opposite! Equivalency describes the ratio of the stats to each other, which can be used to derive the stat weights. In this example, an appropriate set of weights might be agility 3 and strength 2; this works out to agility being [i]1.5 times as valuable[/i] as strength. \r\n[h3]Is there a way to save a template that I have created?[/h3]\r\nThere sure is! You can save your stat weighting scales by going to the \'Preset\' dropdown menu, selecting \'custom,\' and then filling in your own weights. After you\'ve modified them to your liking, you can hit \'Save\' to give them a name so they can be used for future searches as well.\r\n\r\nWeights also carry over from one item list to another if you use the database menu, so going from a [url=/?items=2&filter=wt=51:48:49;wtv=83:67:58]weighted list of weapons[/url] to the [url=/?items=4&filter=wt=51:48:49;wtv=83:67:58]cloth armor listing[/url] will also maintain your current weight scale. \r\n[h3]Is it better to match sockets and gain the socket bonus, or use the best gems?[/h3]\r\nThe weighting system answers this for you automatically. It compares the score of matching gems plus the score of the socket bonus, to the score of the best gems it could put in that item. It will automatically put in the gems that result in the highest net rating, taking socket bonuses into account. When the socket colors are matched, the socket bonus text will be listed below the gems for each item. \r\n\r\n[h3]What are the default weight presets based on?[/h3]\r\nWe\'ve done a great deal of research, tracking down equivalence points for all of the classes.

Email your suggestions to [feedback].[/li]\r\n[li]Don\'t weight stats that your character is [b]already capped on[/b] (e.g. Hit rating).

Then, if you browse around on other pages using the menus at the top, your weight scale will be applied to that page as well.[/li]\r\n[/ul]\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab name=Why?]\r\n\r\n[h3]Why does it give a higher score to 2H weapons over 1H weapons, when using a 1H + OH is better?[/h3]\r\nThe scores are based off the stat weights of the item by itself. Two-handers rank higher because by themselves they do have better stats than a one-hander with nothing else in the off hand. If you add up the scores of a main hand and off hand item, the total score is what you should use to compare to that of a two-hander. We do not assume a score for your offhand item, as there is no way of knowing what you have or can obtain for that slot unless you do a weighted search for it. \r\n[h3]Why does the preset list X as more important than Y?[/h3]\r\nSome attributes come in unusual value ranges on items, which affects their equivalency to other stats. It does not mean that your should focus on or ignore that stat, but that a single point of it is worth more or less compared to other stats. Stats with high number ranges (armor, weapon damage, penetration, etc) will require smaller weight values, while stats with low number ranges (mana regeneration) will require much larger weight values.\r\n\r\nIn essence, giving mana regeneration a score of 100 and healing a score of 25 does [b]not[/b] say that mana regeneration is more important than healing, simply that each point of mana regeneration is the equivalent of 4 points of healing.\r\n[h3]Why don\'t you have a preset for PvP/Tier 6 Raiding/...? Why doesn\'t your preset give a stat value for X?[/h3]\r\nIf you would like to suggest changes to the existing presets or new presets for other specs or situations, please do so to [feedback]. \r\n[h3]Why doesn\'t the preset limit the items to X, Y, and Z?[/h3]\r\nThe weight presets are for sorting; filters are for limiting the search results. If you want to restrict the items you see, use the appropriate tool - the filter options. The only limit applied by the weight scales is that it will not display items with a score of 0 or less. You should continue to use the existing filtering system if you want to see items of a specific type, slot, source, speed, etc.\r\n[h3]Why does it suggest the gems it does for the sockets?[/h3]\r\nThe suggested gems are based on your weights. If you would like to see a different gem in the sockets, try increasing the weight of the appropriate stat. If you feel the weights in the presets need to be adjusted, please let us know at [feedback].\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[/tabs]'),(NULL,NULL,0,'help=screenshots-tips-tricks',0,2,'[menu tab=2 path=2,13,2]\r\n\r\nWe thrive on user contributions!

It should showcase the main object, but take into account the details around it. The same 7 elements of art design come into play here, Line, Shape, Form, Space, Texture, Light & Color. We\'ll touch on several of these and how to make use of the in game settings and mechanics to enhance your pictures.\r\n\r\nTurn your resolution and color sampling as high as your computer can handle. Turn on all the image effects and details, but turn down the weather effects to the lowest setting. In general you want all your glow and spell effects maxed to really show the environment to its fullest potential (they actually help with the lighting too!) You may find a shot that you need to play with these settings to enhance, sometimes turning down environmental detail is helpful to remove extra grasses.\r\n\r\nWorld of Warcraft actually has an internal setting for screenshot quality, and by default that quality is set to [b]3/10[/b].  You can turn this up, though, in order to take higher quality screenshots.  In order to do so, type this command into your chatbox:\r\n\r\n[code]/console screenshotQuality 10[/code]\r\n\r\nMost of the time taking the pictures from 1st person view works best, so zoom all the way in so that you\'re looking through your character\'s eyes. Occasionally the object might be too big (large NPCs especially) to use this view - if this is the case get as close to them as you can without having your body in the shot and swing the camera around to get the angle that you\'re looking for.\r\n\r\nPay attention to the light - a well lit picture is 10 times better than a dark one. You may even want to do a little color correcting before uploading - increase the brightness and contrast a touch. For instance - it\'s a lot easier to take pictures in sunny Stormwind than deep in the mountains of torch lit Ironforge. Daytime pictures also turn out better than night.\r\n\r\n[h3]Featuring Armor[/h3]\r\n\r\n[screenshot url=STATIC_URL/images/help/screenshots/armor.jpg thumb=STATIC_URL/images/help/screenshots/armor2.jpg float=right]Dreamwalker Spaulders[/screenshot]We want to see the armor! Not Joe Schmoe in the armor. In general you want close ups of the piece itself (except for full set pictures). Don\'t be afraid to submit a 4 inch picture of one glove. Once\'s it\'s cropped and loaded and shrunk down to the thumbnail it will look great!\r\n\r\nUse your best judgment when cropping armor pics, but remember - we want to see details of the armor - not the person or a far away image. Of course, this also applies to weapons or any other piece of equipment!\r\n\r\n[h3]Featuring NPCs[/h3]\r\n\r\n[screenshot url=STATIC_URL/images/help/screenshots/npc.jpg thumb=STATIC_URL/images/help/screenshots/npc2.jpg float=right]Cairne Bloodhoof <High Chieftain>[/screenshot]Full body shots should be the norm. If you can\'t get a good full shot (e.g. they\'re standing behind a counter) get the waist up shot. There\'s no need to include the on-screen text and titles of NPCs. The website already lists those, so just get in close and take a great shot of the NPC itself.\r\n\r\nGet down on their level - you may need to \"/sit\" or even \"/sleep\" to get a good view of something low to the ground (scorpions, boots, spiders, etc.)\r\n\r\nWhen capturing moving NPCs, try to get as much a head on front shot as you can, being willing to take a few hits while you take picture of a mob attacking you can make for a great shot. If you don\'t want to get your hands dirty, sitting in place for a while and waiting for it to path in front of you is often easier and faster than running around it trying to get your shot.\r\n\r\nTalking to friendly NPCs will usually make them face you - you can then spin around and get the best background for your picture.

From the [b]Characters[/b] tab you can remove one or more claimed characters. The [b]Profiles[/b] tab allows you to create a new profile, delete profiles, or change the visibility settings of profiles. Your private profiles will not be visible to anyone else.\r\n\r\n[i]Tip: When you are logged in, all of your characters and custom profiles can be accessed from the [b]My profiles[/b] menu at the top right of any page![/i][pad]\r\n[h3]Saving Your Work[/h3]\r\nAny profile can be edited, even if you don\'t own it, but you\'ll probably want to save your work when you\'re done! You must have an account with us in order to save a profile. Once you\'ve created an account, you can bookmark any number of Armory characters and save up to 10 custom profiles. Premium users will be able to create even more, so upgrade if 10 just isn\'t enough! You can use the red buttons to save a profile from its page, and manage your existing profiles and characters from your user page. \r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab name=\"Inventory and talents\"]\r\n[img src=STATIC_URL/images/help/profiler/character.jpg height=300 float=right]The main tab for a profile is the character inventory, which includes a lot of the same information you would see by looking at your character pane in game. This tab is broken up into four key sections - the character view, quick facts box, statistics, and gear summary.\r\n\r\n[h3]Character View[/h3]\r\nThe first thing you\'ll notice, of course, is your character – as rendered by our custom built modelviewer, in all it\'s three-dimensional glory. You can turn the character with your mouse, and zoom in and out using the A and Z keys, just like the modelviewer elsewhere in the site.  [b]We even pull your face, hair, and skin color information from the Armory![/b]\r\n\r\nOn either side of the character are inventory icons which you can right click on for a menu of options:\r\n\r\n[i]Tip: You can remove a gem or enchant by clicking None in the picker window or by right clicking on it in the gear summary.[/i]\r\n\r\n[ul]\r\n[li][img src=STATIC_URL/images/help/profiler/itemmenu.gif float=right][b]Equip... / Replace...[/b] – Selecting this option will give you a quick search box in which you can type an item\'s name. Click on the item or hit return to equip it.\r\nUnequip – Unequips the item, of course. :)[/li]\r\n[li][b]Add / Replace enchant...[/b] – The spell icon on the left shows if the item is enchanted. This opens a customized picker window with all enchants available for the item slot.[/li]\r\n[li][b]Add / Replace gem...[/b] – The icon on the left shows the socket color or socketed gem. Like the enchants, this opens a picker window with valid gems for the socket.[/li]\r\n[li][b]Extra socket[/b] – The check mark on the left indicates if a blacksmithing socket has been added to this item. Click to toggle on or off.[/li]\r\n[li][b]Clear Enhancements[/b] - This will remove all reforges, enchantments, gems and extra sockets from an item. Useful if you want to start fresh with an item.[/li]\r\n[li][b]Display on character[/b] – The checkmark on the left indicates if the item is displayed on the  model. Click to toggle on or off – it works for more than just cloaks and helms![/li]\r\n[li][b]Compare[/b] – Adds the item to the [url=/?compare]item comparison tool[/url] and opens it in a new window to compare with other items.[/li]\r\n[li][b]Find upgrades[/b] – Uses our [url=/?help=stat-weighting]weighted search[/url] to find upgrades based on your talent spec.[/li]\r\n[li][b]Who wears this?[/b] – Creates a filtered list of other Armory characters who are also wearing the item.[/li]\r\n[/ul]\r\n\r\n[i]Tip: Items that can take enchantments but have no enchantment, or which have empty sockets, will even have a little notification in the tooltip![/i]\r\n\r\n[img src=STATIC_URL/images/help/profiler/quickfacts.gif float=right][h3]Quick Facts Box[/h3]\r\nOn the right hand side is a handy Quick Facts box that displays basic, defining information about a profile. This box is chock full of useful information, including talent spec, achievement points, and professions.\r\n\r\n[i]Tip: Any raid icon that\'s ringed in [color=c4]gold[/color] is a raid that the character has cleared![/i]\r\n[h3]Statistics[/h3]\r\nYou\'ll also notice that all of a profile\'s statistics are laid out beneath the character view. This is also all information you can get from the Armory (and then some), but we lay it out in a nice, convenient page so you can view it all at once – no more messing with drop down menus. You can also click on a statistic and expand it so you can see its tooltip information right there on the page—or click on the header to expand all the related statistics. Your statistics are updated as you edit any part of a profile, including race, class, level, items, enhancements, or talents – all in real time! [b]Statistic modifications from glyphs and buffs are not presently supported, but will be in the future.[/b]\r\n\r\n[i]Note: These statistics are calculated manually – they are not pulled from the Armory. Statistics calculations are still in beta and will ironed out as we go.[/i]\r\n\r\n[img src=STATIC_URL/images/help/profiler/statistics.gif float=center]\r\n\r\n[h3]Gear Summary[/h3]\r\n[div float=right align=right][img src=STATIC_URL/images/help/profiler/gearsummary.gif]\r\n[small]A warning message is displayed for missing enhancements.[/small][/div]Last on the character inventory tab, but not least, is the gear summary. This is a personalized list of all items worn by the character, with convenient column headers and in line filtering options. Use it to see where most of a character\'s items come from, what is the best and worst piece, and whether or not there are missing gems and enchants. Just in case the empty icons aren\'t clear enough, a warning appears at the top of the list if a character is missing gems, enchants, or blacksmith sockets. This [color=q10]warning[/color] is based on the professions of the character if it is an Armory profile, and otherwise shows you everything missing on custom profiles.\r\n\r\nThe gems and enchants can also be edited from within the gear summary, and have a few additional options not available in the character view. You can remove or replace an enhancement from here, and you can find upgrades using our [url=/?help=stat-weighting]weighted search[/url] – just like items!\r\n\r\n[h3]Talents[/h3]\r\nThe talents tab includes an inline version of our [url=/?talent]talent calculator[/url] with a full display of a character\'s talents. It is locked by default, but you can unlock it to begin editing talents, just as you would normally. There are two extra features in the Profiler\'s talent calculator: you can store and swap between two specs for each character, and export the current talent build to the calculator to link to your friends. When you change your talents (or swap between specs) your gear score and statistics will be updates real time!\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab name=\"Other tabs\"]\r\n\r\n[h3]Reputation[/h3]\r\nThe reputation tab displays the complete faction information of an Armory character, with collapsible headers for each section. Its much easier to read than the tiny faction pane in game! Of course, you can link directly to the faction\'s page to get more information about that faction. \r\n[h3][img src=STATIC_URL/images/help/profiler/achievements.gif float=right]Achievements[/h3]\r\nThe achievements tab lists an Armory character\'s progress in each of the main achievement categories, and has a filterable list of achievements including date completed. All of the normal column and list filters are available, along with some new ones! You can filter the list by earned, in progress or complete achievements – complete are displayed by default – or click on any of the category progress bars to only display achievements from that category.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab name=Completion_Tracker]\r\n\r\n[img src=STATIC_URL/images/help/profiler/quests.jpg float=right width=450]You can use the Profiler\'s [b]Completion Tracker[/b] feature to keep track of your quests, achievements, pets, mounts, recipes, and more!\r\n\r\n[h3]Getting Started[/h3]\r\n\r\nIn order to start tracking your completion data, all you need to do is visit your character\'s page on the profiler and resync it. This will automatically collect data about your character\'s completed achievements, companion pets, mounts, quests, recipes, reputations and titles.\r\n\r\n[h3][img src=STATIC_URL/images/help/profiler/completion.jpg float=right]Tracking Your Completion Data[/h3]\r\n\r\nOnce you\'ve got your data up on the site, it will be available in the form of five new tabs: [b]mounts[/b], [b]companions[/b], [b]recipes[/b], [b]quests[/b], and [b]titles[/b].\r\n\r\nIf you open the mounts, companions, or titles tabs, you\'ll immediately be greeted by a list of all the entries you\'ve already completed.  You can cycle through the different tabs to see the ones you already have, the ones you still have yet to collect, a complete list, or a list of just the ones you\'ve \"excluded\" (more on that shortly).  You can also use the \"Search within results\" box to search the list based on a keyword, just like you can with other search results in the database.\r\n\r\nThe recipe, and quest tabs, like the Achievements tab, contain more entries—so you\'ll be presented with a box like the one shown above.  From there, all you have to do is click one of the progress bars to see the complete tabbed list in each category.\r\n\r\n[h3]Exclusions[/h3]\r\n\r\nWhen you\'re trying to make sure we check off every quest, achievement, or mount on our list, everyone knows that there are some that you just don\'t want to bother with.  To that end, we\'ve created [b]exclusions[/b].\r\n\r\n[img src=STATIC_URL/images/help/profiler/exclusions.jpg float=right]Using exclusions, you can flag certain quests, mounts, achievements, recipes, pets, or titles that \"don\'t count\" toward your completion total.  When you exclude (for example) a quest, that quest no longer appears in \"incomplete\" listings, and the total number of quests in that category is reduced by one.\r\n\r\n[b]For example:[/b] There are 632 quests in the \"Eastern Kingdoms\" category. If I were to decide that [quest=367] is for noobs and I don\'t want to count it, then all I have to do is put a check in the box next to the quest and click \"Exclude\".  After I do so, the Eastern Kingdoms progress bar will only show [i]631[/i] quests total—the remaining quest will appear in the \"Excluded\" tab but won\'t be counted for anything else.\r\n\r\nIf you want to re-include a quest, just go to the \"Excluded\" tab and then use the checkboxes to restore as many as you like.  You can do the same thing for achievements, titles, mounts, pets, or recipes.\r\n\r\nIf you [b]complete[/b] a quest that you have excluded, it will show in the progress bar as a [b]+1[/b].  Example: If there are 31 quests in the \"Miscellaneous\" category, and I\'ve completed 20 quests and excluded 1, the progress bar will show [b]20/30[/b].  If I have completed [i]the quest that I excluded[/i], then the progress bar will show [b]20(+1)/30[/b].  If I then go on to complete ALL the quests in that category (including the one I excluded), the progress bar will show [b]30(+1)/30[/b].\r\n\r\n[b]Exclusion Manager[/b]\r\nThe companions and mounts tabs let you manage your exclusions en masse with the Exclusion Manager.  Just click the \"Manage Exclusions\" button on top of the tabs to see a list of convenient categories you might want to exclude.  There\'s also a \"reset all\" button here to let you wipe all of your exclusions and start over.\r\n\r\n[b]Note:[/b] The Exclusion Manager is currently only available for companions and mounts.\r\n\r\n[i]Tip: Exclusions are tied to your account, not to a particular character.  This is so even when you look at someone else\'s character, you\'re judging them by [/i]your[i] completion standards, not anyone else\'s![/i] \r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab name=Calculations]\r\n\r\nMost of the information we display is pretty straightforward. A lot of it, particularly the stats on items, is readily available in our database and on various tooltips. There are some new numbers on profile pages that you may ask, what does this number mean? How was it calculated?\r\n[h3]Base Statistics[/h3]\r\nA character\'s five base statistics are determined primarily by his or her class and level. This base amount has a modifier applied to it depending on the character\'s race. We gathered an extensive amount of data from the armory to come up with these base numbers, using untalented individuals of every race, class, and level combination. Because racial modifiers are consistent, we are able to create statistics for \"fake\" race and class combos using the data we already know. However, the Armory does not give data on characters below level 10 or Death Knights below level 55, so we have no statistic information for these profiles. To simplify things, we have set a minimum level for custom profiles based on the available statistics.\r\n[h3]Gear Score[/h3]\r\nOkay, so a lot of sites have gear scores. Most of them (ours included) are based around the [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Item_level]item budget[/url] Blizzard uses to determine how much of each stat can be on an item. This budget is calculated using the item\'s level, quality, and slot, and we use the budget as the item\'s gear score. You can view a complete breakdown of an item\'s gear score by mousing over it in the [url=/?help=profiler#profiler-inventory-and-talents]gear summary[/url] at the bottom of the character tab. You can view a breakdown of a profile\'s total gear score by mousing over it in the Quick Facts box, also on the character tab.\r\n\r\nEach gear score is color coded based on the item levels of the gear in reference to the character level. [b][color=q0]Grey[/color][/b] for poor, [b][color=q1]White[/color][/b] for common, [b][color=q2]Green[/color][/b] for uncommon, [b][color=q3]Blue[/color][/b] for rare, [b][color=q4]Purple[/color][/b] for epic and [b][color=q5]Orange[/color][/b] for legendary. For example, a level 70 character wearing high item-level, raiding epics from [zone=3606] and [zone=3959] will have a purple-colored gearscore, as their items are considerably \"epic\" quality for their level. However, the same character at 80, if wearing this same gear,  will have the gearscore colored blue as the items are of lower-than-optimal quality for their level.\r\n\r\nThe value of an empty socket was generated using the gear score of appropriate gems for the item in question, and subtracted from the item\'s score. This allows us to score unsocketed items lower than an item without sockets of the same level, quality, and slot. Items with better than expected gems will receive higher scores, and items with lower quality gems (or no gems at all) will receive lower scores.\r\n\r\nThe values of enchants are based off of the level of the enchantment.  Endgame enchantments are 20 points, profession perks are 40 points, etc.  The numbers go down from there.\r\n\r\nYou may notice that some profiles have different gear scores for the same item. There is an extreme difference in budget between a two-handed or one-handed weapon, which causes a discrepancy in scores between characters who should be fairly equal according to the level of their gear. To address this, the gear score of weapons has been normalized so that a character with appropriate weapon choices has the equivalent score of two two-handed weapons. Appropriate weapons are determined by your class and spec; for example, an enhancement shaman should dual wield one handed weapons, a protection warrior should have a one-hander and shield, etc. For classes which the melee weapons don\'t really matter – like hunters or spellcasters – anything they can use is considered appropriate.\r\n\r\n[i]Note: Gear score does not take into account the stats of the item. It is a measurement of quality of gear, not whether the stats on the gear are suited to the character\'s spec.[/i]\r\n\r\n[h3]Guild Scores[/h3]\r\nGuild gear scores and achievement points are derived using a weighted average of all of the known characters in that guild. Guilds with at least 25 level 80 players receive full benefit of the top 25 characters\' gear scores, while guilds with at least 10 level 80 characters receive a slight penalty, at least 1 level 80 a moderate penalty, and no level 80 characters a severe penalty. This is to prevent small guilds and bank alts from appearing to have higher scores than legitimate raiding guilds. Instead of being based on level, achievement point averages are based around 1,500 points, but the same penalties apply.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[/tabs]'),(8,577,0,NULL,0,2,'[minibox]\n[h2]Steamwheedle Cartel[/h2]\n[faction=21]\n[faction=577]\n[faction=369]\n[b]Everlook[/b]\n[/minibox]\n\n[b]Everlook[/b], the faction of the town Everlook, is a trading post is run by the goblins of the Steamwheedle Cartel.

It is run by goblins as a trading post and is officially neutral to all races and factions. Even so, pilgrims allowed to venture up to the World Tree stop here, but otherwise this is the highest that merchants and explorers may venture without the night elves’ permission. Everlook would offer a commanding view of Kalimdor, if it were not at such a high altitude that clouds constantly shroud the mountain’s lower flanks.\n\nEverlook is the only major goblin outpost in northern Kalimdor, and it serves several purposes. First, it serves as the base of operations for goblin thorium and arcanite miners since Winterspring has some of the few untapped veins of those materials on the continent. Second, it serves as a center of trade between the Alliance and the Horde. While Everlook is hardly as safe as Moonglade, generally the Alliance and the Horde treat each other fairly well there. Additionally, Everlook is a frequent stop-off and resupply point for the faithful who make the pilgrimage through Winterspring to Hyjal Summit.\n\n[h3]Reputation[/h3]\nReputation for Everlook and the Steamwheedle Cartel is mostly gained from quests in Winterspring.

Tooltip Data[/h3]\r\nOur tooltips come with some information that the in-game tooltips do not display. If you\'d like your tooltips to exactly resemble the in-game ones, you can disable the following components on our\'s: \r\n[ul][li][b]reagents[/b]: At the very bottom of recipe tooltips, we add a line describing the recipe\'s reagents \"Requires Gromsblood (2), Crystal Vial (1)\"[/li]\r\n[li][b]sellprice[/b]: Blizzard added the item sell price to all item tooltips, but you can hide it as well by setting this option.[/li][/ul]\r\n\r\nYou can disable it by adding a \"hide\" section to the tooltip HTML code in the <head> section and then specifying what parts you\'d like hidden. If you wanted to hide only the Dropped By and Drop Chance information, your code would be as follows:\r\n[code]<script>var aowow_tooltips = { \"colorlinks\": true, \"iconizelinks\": true, \"renamelinks\": true, \"hide\": { \"reagents\": true, \"sellprice\": true} }</script>[/code]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab name=\"XML feeds\"]\r\n\r\n[h3]Items[/h3]\r\nAlso available are our item XML feeds. Every item in the database has a corresponding XML feed. You can reach those feeds either by ID or by name. For example:\r\n\r\n[ul]\r\n[li]By ID: HOST_URL?item=52021&xml[/li]\r\n[li]By name: HOST_URL?item=iceblade%20arrow&xml[/li]\r\n[/ul]\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab name=\"Other resources\"]\r\n\r\nInterested in using our script in your forum?

Le montant perdu pour tuer un citoyen ne peut pas être démontré car il dépend de votre niveau actuel avec Baie-du-Butin et de l\'importance de la personne que vous tuez. En plus de cela, quand vous perdez de la réputation avec Baie-du-Butin, vous perdez la moitié dans les trois autres villes du Cartel Gentepression. Par exemple, si vous perdez 25 points avec Baie-du-Butin, vous perdrez 12,5 points avec [faction=470].\n\nLe moyen le plus rapide d\'augmenter votre réputation avec les Pirates de la Voile Sanglante est de tuer des habitants de Baie-du-Butin. Au début, cela peut sembler une tâche simple car les gardes n\'apparaissent pas aussi menaçants que les autres monstres auxquels un joueur est confronté dans le jeu. Cependant, les gardes sont très équipés pour neutraliser les joueurs de toute classe, afin d\'éviter que les gens ne s\'attaquent les uns les autres dans la ville. \n\nLe Cogneur de Baie-du-butin a l\'avantage avec plusieurs capacités. Lune dentre elle est lutilisation de filet pour vous bloquer sur place, vous empêchant de vous échapper. Une autre est le fait qu\'ils appellent dautres Cogneurs chaque fois que vous attaquiez un citoyen de la ville ou si vous êtes sous un statut hostile avec Baie-du-Butin, les joueurs peuvent bientôt se retrouver rapidement submergés par les Cogneurs.\nLa capacité la plus forte du Cogneur est quune fois qu\'il tire son arme, il est peu probable que vous vivez, si vous ne vous échappez pas assez vite. Chaque fois qu\'un Cogneur vous tire dessus, l\'attaque vous retient, tout comme une attaque de marteau d\'Ogre. La différence ici, est que le Cogneur peut tirer rapidement en succession, provoquant des lances de chaîne. Un joueur peut littéralement être jeté d\'un côté de la ville à l\'autre, ce qui vous empêche d\'attaquer. Plus souvent, vous vous retrouverez coincé dans un coin, incapable de bouger et incapable d\'attaquer avec tous les sortilèges interrompues par l\'attaque du Cogneur. Parce que les Cogneurs ne rangent pas leurs armes à feu une fois qu\'elles sont sorties, la meilleure façon d\'agir est de s\'enfuir.\n\nPar essais et erreurs, la plupart des gens ont découvert un endroit sûr pour tuer les Cogneurs de Baie-du-Butin. Si vous suivez le tunnel qui mène à la ville, le chemin de votre gauche qui mène à la maison du Forgeron est l\'endroit idéal pour tuer les gardes. Seuls deux gardes patrouillent sur ce chemin. Une fois qu\'ils sont partis, entrer dans la première construction sur le chemin pour provoquer un rassemblement. Un joueur devrait pouvoir tuer 2 à 4 Cogneurs avant que les deux Cogneurs de patrouille en appellent dautres. En moyenne, un joueur qui fait cela peut tuer environ 30 à 40 Cogneurs de Baie-du-Butin, gagnant environ 800 points de réputation auprès de la Voile Sanglante. Les Cogneurs ici ne semblent pas sortir leurs armes, mais si vous vous trouvez dans une mauvaise situation, vous pouvez sauter sur la balustrade, courir sur le chemin des eaux, pour vous échapper.\n\nPour augmenter votre réputation au-delà de honoré, seuls deux NPC vous le permettent : \n[ul]\n[li] [npc=9179] : 5 points de réputation toutes les 7 minutes jusquà révéré [/li]\n[li] [npc=26081]: 5 points de réputation toutes les 24 heures jusquà exalté [/li]\n[/Ul]\n\n[h3]Récompenses[/h3]\n\nDevenir amical avec Les Pirates de la Voile Sanglante, vous donnera accès aux éléments suivants :\n[ul]\n[li] [item=12185] - Invoque un [npc=11236] [/li]\n[li] [item=22742] [/li]\n[li] [item=22743] [/li]\n[li] [item=22745] [/li]\n[/Ul]\nVous aurez besoin d\'être honoré avec la Voile Sanglante pour [achievement=2336].'),(8,70,2,NULL,0,2,'Le[b] Syndicat [/b] est une organisation criminelle humaine qui opère principalement dans les [zone=45] et les [zone=36], bien que quelques petits campements soient éparpillés dans les [zone=267].
