    (0, 'reputation', 2, '[b]Reputation[/b] is a rough measurement of how much you participate in the community--it is earned by convincing your peers that you know what youâ€™re talking about. Our community puts just as much work as our developers do into making our site as awesome as it is and reputation is meant as a way for you to track just how much work you\'re putting into us.\r\n\r\nThe primary means of gaining reputation is by posting quality comments on database entries (which are then voted up by other site members) and by general contributions to the site which can include actions like data and screenshot submissions. Whenever you leave a comment on a database entry, your peers can then vote on these comments, and those votes will cause you to gain  reputation. You can also earn reputation by voting on other users\' comments and by sending in reports!\r\n\r\nBy being a good-standing and contributing user you will be able to earn both reputation and achievements for many of the same actions!\r\n\r\n[h3]Reputation Gains[/h3]\r\n[div style="max-width:400px"][table class=grid]\r\n[tr][td][url=?account=signup]Registering[/url] an account[/td]\r\n[td align=right class=no-wrap]CFG_REP_REWARD_REGISTER reputation[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr][td]Daily visit[/td]\r\n[td align=right class=no-wrap]CFG_REP_REWARD_DAILYVISIT reputation[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr][td]Posting a comment[/td]\r\n[td align=right class=no-wrap]CFG_REP_REWARD_COMMENT reputation[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr][td]Your comment was voted up (each upvote)[/td]\r\n[td align=right class=no-wrap]CFG_REP_REWARD_UPVOTED reputation[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr][td]Submitting a screenshot[/td]\r\n[td align=right class=no-wrap]CFG_REP_REWARD_UPLOAD reputation[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr][td]Submitting a guide (approved)[/td]\r\n[td align=right class=no-wrap]CFG_REP_REWARD_ARTICLE reputation[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr][td]Filing a report (accepted)[/td]\r\n[td align=right class=no-wrap]CFG_REP_REWARD_GOOD_REPORT reputation[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[/table][/div]\r\n\r\n\r\n[h3]Site Privileges[/h3]\r\nThe higher your reputation level, the more privileges you gain.
