Perenolde believed that a Horde victory was inevitable, and thus offered aid to the Horde by stirring up rebellions, attacking Alliance bases, and giving them supplies. When this treachery was discovered, the Alliance marched on Alterac and destroyed it. Perenolde and any nobles who went along with his plans were stripped of their titles and land. Many of the nobility managed to escape, however, and began plotting their revenge. Using their still sizable fortunes, the nobility hired a band of thieves and assassins, forming an organization known as the Syndicate.\n\nAt first the Syndicate\'s goal was just to spread chaos and disorder, striking from hidden bases in the Alterac Mountains. With the end of the Third War and the resultant chaos however, the leaders of the Syndicate saw their chance to return Alterac to its former power. They have now gained control of several outposts in the surrounding area including the sacked fortress of Durnholde Keep and a portion of the city of Stromgarde.\n\nThey are enemies of both the Alliance, whom they consider their mortal enemies, and the Horde, whom they consider mere brutes good for nothing but slave labor. As a result, the Syndicate is now hunted by both factions, with the [npc=10181], in particular, placing a bounty on their heads - guaranteeing that all captured Syndicate members will be summarily executed.

However, the quest requires [item=16885] ... which only rogues can obtain by pick-pocketing NPCs above level fifty, and those can only be traded to you - making it difficult to arrange such a transaction.\n\nCurrently there is only one known option to increase a player’s reputation with the Syndicate, and that is by killing members of the [faction=349] faction. There are no known rewards for increasing Syndicate reputation, and Ravenholdt-affiliated NPCs only give 1 Syndicate Reputation points, with the exception of [npc=13085], who gives 5 (although the corresponding loss of reputation with Ravenholdt is also five times as great). With all players starting at 32000/36000 hated with the faction, it would require killing 10,000 Ravenholdt NPCs to reach Neutral status with the faction; unfortunately, neutral status is the highest you can reach with the Syndicate, and if not to deter players further, none of the Ravenholdt NPCs drop loot.\n\n[b]WARNING[/b]: If you do decide to kill Ravenholdt NPCs, know that there is currently no way to restore your standings with Ravenholdt, if you do go below Neutral. The reason for the problem is that none of the quests that give Ravenholdt Reputation points will be available because none of the members from Ravenholdt will speak to you. This would mean its a permanent change and you will never be able to interact with any of the NPC loyal to Ravenholdt ever again.

In addition, a scouting party has landed just west of the entrance to the town, reporting all activities, along with a compound being constructed along the road leading towards the town, likely to stop any re-enforcements from coming to help.\n\nBoth the Bloodsail Buccaneers and Blackwater Raiders seek to achieve their goals without having their forces engaged in battle, to this end each side now seek the aid of adventurers sympathetic to their cause.\n\n[h3]Reputation[/h3]\nThere is only one way to increase your reputation with the Bloodsail Buccaneers and that’s to unleash your wrath on any citizen of Booty Bay who can be found through out the Eastern Kingdoms. Below is a list of every citizen of Booty Bay and their reputation value. The amount gained with the Bloodsail Buccaneers is shown for a level 60 non-human. The amount lost for killing a citizen cannot be shown as it depends on your current level with Booty Bay and the importance of the person you kill. In addition to this what ever you lose with Booty Bay you will lose half of that in the other three goblin towns so if you lose 25 points in Booty Bay you will lose 12.5 points in [faction=470].\n\n[ul]\n[li][npc=4624]: 25 rep gained[/li]\n[li][npc=15088]: 25 rep gained[/li]\n[li][npc=2496]: 5 rep gained[/li]\n[li][npc=2636]: 5 rep gained[/li]\n[li][url=?npcs&filter=cr=3;crs=21;crv=0]Many more NPCs[/url]![/li]\n[/ul]\n\nThe fastest way to increase you reputation with the Bloodsail Buccaneers is to kill Booty Bay Bruisers. At first it may seem a simple task as the guards don\'t appear as threatening as the other monsters a player faces within the game. However, the guards are highly equipped to neutralize players of any class, to prevent people from attacking each other while in the town. What gives the Booty Bay Bruiser the advantage is several factors, one of them being their ability to use nets to lock you in place, preventing you from escaping. Another is the fact that they spawn every time you attack a citizen of the city or if you’re under Unfriendly status with Booty Bay the Bruisers can spawn if you enter a building, because of this players can soon find them selves swarmed by Bruisers.\n\nYet, theses are just the minor problems, in comparison to the Bruiser’s strongest ability, once it pulls out its gun its unlikely you will live, if you do not escape fast enough. Each time a guard shoots you, the attack throws you back, much like an Ogre hammer attack; the difference here is that the Bruiser can shoot in quick succession causing chain throw backs. A player can literally be thrown from one side of the town to the other, preventing you from attacking. More often you will find your self being forced into a corner, unable to move and unable to attack with each spell being interrupted by the Bruiser’s attack. Because the Bruisers do not put their guns away once they are out, the best course of action is to run away. \n\nThrough trial and error most people have discovered a safe place to kill Booty Bay Bruisers. If you follow the tunnel leading into the town, the path to your left that leads to the Blacksmith house is the ideal place to kill the guards. Only two guards patrol this path and normally don’t pass each other that closely, allowing both to be dispatched separately. Once they are gone, one can simply enter the first build on the path to cause a guard to spawn if they are below Unfriendly, if not they can simply attack one of the two NPC in the build, both of which are not high in level. Doing this a player should be able to kill 2 to 4 Bruisers before the two patrolling Bruisers re-spawn. On average a player doing this can kill about 30 to 40 Booty Bay Bruisers gaining about 800 reputation points with the pirates. The Bruisers here don’t appear to pull out their guns, but if you find your self in a bad situation, you can jump over the railing running along the path to the waters below, to escape.\n\n[h3]Rewards[/h3]\nBecoming friendly with the Bloodsail Buccaneers will grant you access to the following items:\n\n[ul]\n[li][item=12185] - Summons a [npc=11236][/li]\n[li][item=22742][/li]\n[li][item=22743][/li]\n[li][item=22745][/li]\n[/ul]\n\nYou will need Honored with the Bloodsail Buccaneers for [achievement=2336].',NULL),(8,92,0,'[b]Gelkis[/b] are a tribe of centaur who have made their home in the southmost parts of [zone=405].

Over time two distinct troll empires emerged - the Amani and the Gurubashi. They existed for thousands of years until the coming of the Night Elves, who warred with them and eventually drove both empires into exile. \n\nFollowing the Great Sundering, the defeated Gurubashi grew ever more desperate to eke out a living. Searching for a means to survive, they enlisted the aid of the savage [npc=14834], also known as the Soulflayer. Hakkar grew into a merciless oppressor who demanded daily sacrifices from his devotees, and so in time the Gurubashi turned on their dark master. The strongest tribes (including the Zandalar) banded together to defeat Hakkar and his loyal troll priests, the Atal\'ai. The united tribes narrowly defeated the Blood God and cast out the Atal\'ai... despite their victory, however, the Gurubashi Empire soon fell. \n\nIn recent years the exiled Atal\'ai priests have discovered that Hakkar\'s physical form can only be summoned within the ancient and once-deserted capital of the Gurubashi Empire, Zul\'Gurub. Unfortunately, the priests have met with success in their quest to call forth Hakkar—reports confirm the presence of the dreaded Soulflayer in the heart of the ruins. \n\nAnd so the Zandalar tribe has arrived on the shores of Azeroth to battle Hakkar once again. But the Blood God has grown increasingly powerful, bending several tribes to his will and even commanding the avatars of the Primal Gods— Bat, Panther, Tiger, Spider and Snake. With the tribes splintered, the Zandalarians have been forced to recruit champions from Azeroth\'s varied and disparate races to battle, and hopefully once again defeat, the Soulflayer.\n\n[h3]Reputation[/h3]\nReputation with the Zandalar Tribe is gained from killing trash and bosses in Zul\'Gurub as well as repeatable and special quests which require instance-dropped items to complete.

Rising out of the northern [zone=440] desert like an oasis, Gadgetzan is the headquarters of the Steamwheedle Cartel, the largest of the Goblin Cartels. The Goblins believe in profit above loyalty, thus Gadgetzan is considered neutral territory in the Horde/Alliance conflict.\n\n[h3]History[/h3]\nAlthough the goblins\' neutrality is almost universally acknowledged, there are still those who seek to sow chaos and anarchy. For Gadgetzan, this comes in the form of the Wastewander bandits, a gang of miscreants who have occupied the Waterspring Field and Noonshade Ruins of northeast Tanaris. Few goblins care about ancient ruins (unless they have treasure) – for all they care, the bandits can have the old blocks of stone. \n\nHowever, the Waterspring Field is vital to the goblins\' survival in the desert, providing them with the liquid gold of the desert. Water towers out in the field were constructed under the blazing heat of the desert sun by the backbreaking work of their slaves, and by Az, the goblins aren\'t going to give up their hard earned towers that easily. However, the Bruisers need to stay in town to keep the gnomes\' collective Napoleonic-complex from getting out of hand and to stop the seemingly endless dueling among the various visitors from disrupting business.

Its streets wander without rhyme or reason through neighborhoods dedicated to one activity: commerce. Ramshackle warehouses stand next to stately stone homes. Fine shops press cheek to jowl with rude huts. Wares of every type imaginable - and some beyond the imagination - are on display in markets and in exclusive boutiques.\n\nGoblins welcome anyone with gold or items of value and a willingness to trade them for their wares and services. Merchants throng the marketplaces each day, selling everything from silks to slaves, and even at night the stores lining the twisting streets and alleys remain open for business. Those with the money can listen to skilled musicians while drinking fine ales and eating food prepared by expert chefs. For those with earthier tastes, the streets along the wharf teem with whorehouses, taprooms, and casinos.\n\nRatchet is the largest port on Kalimdor, with as many ships bringing cargo in as there are ships heading out for other sites around Kalimdor. In addition to legitimate trade vessels, pirate craft receive amnesty while in the port of Ratchet as long as they can pay the stiff docking fees.

The Wildhammer Clan was unsuccessful in wresting control of [zone=1537] from the Bronzebeard and Dark Iron clans. Khardros and his Wildhammer warriors traveled north through the barrier gates of Dun Algaz, and founded their own kingdom within the distant peak of Grim Batol. There, the Wildhammers thrived and rebuilt their stores of treasure.\n\n[npc=9019] and his Dark Irons vowed revenge against Ironforge. Thaurissan and his sorceress wife, Modgud, launched a two-pronged assault against both Ironforge and Grim Batol. As Modgud confronted the enemy warriors, she used her powers to strike fear into their hearts. Shadows moved at her command, and dark things crawled up from the depths of the earth to stalk the Wildhammers in their own halls. Eventually Modgud broke through the gates and laid siege to the fortress itself. The Wildhammers fought desperately, Khardros himself wading through the roiling masses to slay the sorceress queen. With their queen lost, the Dark Irons fled before the fury of the Wildhammers.\n\nOnce the immediate Dark Iron threat was eliminated, the Wildhammers returned home to Grim Batol. However, the death of the Modgud had left an evil stain on the mountain fortress, and the Wildhammers found it uninhabitable. Khardros took his people north towards the lands of Lordaeron. Settling within the mountainous region of the Aerie Peaks and The Hinterlands, and lush forests of Northeron, the Wildhammers crafted the city of Aerie Peak, where the Wildhammers grew closer to nature and even bonded with the mighty gryphons of the area. Over time they started calling their land the Hinterlands. \n\n[b]Modern Wildhammers[/b]\nThe Wildhammer Clan currently makes its home at Aerie Peak in the Hinterlands.

This system allows users to submit their own comments to augment the data provided here. As a rule, we promote the submission of informative comments, but we also like to see the occasional joke. Moderators and users alike will apply positive and negative ratings to comments in an effort to promote the useful ones and purge unnecessary information.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, below is a guide that can be used to determine how your comment will likely be received by the community. \r\n\r\n[pad]\r\n\r\n[tabs name=comments]\r\n\r\n[tab name=\"Before you post\"]\r\n\r\n[ul]\r\n[li][b]Read existing comments[/b] – Sometimes, the information you have may already have been posted by another user. In this case, if the information is useful, the existing comment should be given a positive rank. Posting information that was already added in a previous comment will likely result in a negative rating.[pad][/li]\r\n[li][b]Verify your facts[/b] – Make sure that what you have to post is true. A friend might tell you that a mob is immune to Frost Nova, but unless you verify that yourself, you could be posting a potentially misleading comment.[pad][/li]\r\n[li][b]Temporary usability[/b] – If you want to correct invalid or missing information on a page, keep in mind that your comment may go from a positive ranking to a negative ranking when the correction occurs. For example, informing the community that a spell is cast by Illidan Stormrage before that data has been collected will be useful at first, but once Aowow learns to parse that information and adds it to the \'Abilities\' tab, your comment becomes redundant. If you do not want to worry about the comment or do not want one of your comments to be rated negatively, consider informing us in the [url=/?forums&board=1.]Site Feedback[/url] forum.

Each weight value is multiplied by an item\'s stat points and then added together to get the item\'s total score. This score is used to sort the results and display the highest scoring items.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that spell damage is worth twice as much as spell crit, you could add the weights as 2 and 1, 100 and 50, or any other numbers with the same ratio.\r\n\r\nPlease note that weights only work for [url=/?items=4]Armor[/url], [url=/?items=2]Weapons[/url], [url=/?items=3]Gems[/url] and [url=/?items=0]Consumables[/url]. \r\n[h3]What is the difference between weights and equivalency?[/h3]\r\nThe equivalency of two attributes describes how much one equals the other. You may find equivalency ratings that say something like 1 agility = 1.5 strength. This is [b]not[/b] the same as weight values; in fact, it\'s the exact opposite! Equivalency describes the ratio of the stats to each other, which can be used to derive the stat weights. In this example, an appropriate set of weights might be agility 3 and strength 2; this works out to agility being [i]1.5 times as valuable[/i] as strength. \r\n[h3]Is there a way to save a template that I have created?[/h3]\r\nThere sure is! You can save your stat weighting scales by going to the \'Preset\' dropdown menu, selecting \'custom,\' and then filling in your own weights. After you\'ve modified them to your liking, you can hit \'Save\' to give them a name so they can be used for future searches as well.\r\n\r\nWeights also carry over from one item list to another if you use the database menu, so going from a [url=/?items=2&filter=wt=51:48:49;wtv=83:67:58]weighted list of weapons[/url] to the [url=/?items=4&filter=wt=51:48:49;wtv=83:67:58]cloth armor listing[/url] will also maintain your current weight scale. \r\n[h3]Is it better to match sockets and gain the socket bonus, or use the best gems?[/h3]\r\nThe weighting system answers this for you automatically. It compares the score of matching gems plus the score of the socket bonus, to the score of the best gems it could put in that item. It will automatically put in the gems that result in the highest net rating, taking socket bonuses into account. When the socket colors are matched, the socket bonus text will be listed below the gems for each item. \r\n\r\n[h3]What are the default weight presets based on?[/h3]\r\nWe\'ve done a great deal of research, tracking down equivalence points for all of the classes.

Two-handers rank higher because by themselves they do have better stats than a one-hander with nothing else in the off hand. If you add up the scores of a main hand and off hand item, the total score is what you should use to compare to that of a two-hander. We do not assume a score for your offhand item, as there is no way of knowing what you have or can obtain for that slot unless you do a weighted search for it. \r\n[h3]Why does the preset list X as more important than Y?[/h3]\r\nSome attributes come in unusual value ranges on items, which affects their equivalency to other stats. It does not mean that your should focus on or ignore that stat, but that a single point of it is worth more or less compared to other stats. Stats with high number ranges (armor, weapon damage, penetration, etc) will require smaller weight values, while stats with low number ranges (mana regeneration) will require much larger weight values.\r\n\r\nIn essence, giving mana regeneration a score of 100 and healing a score of 25 does [b]not[/b] say that mana regeneration is more important than healing, simply that each point of mana regeneration is the equivalent of 4 points of healing.\r\n[h3]Why don\'t you have a preset for PvP/Tier 6 Raiding/...? Why doesn\'t your preset give a stat value for X?[/h3]\r\nIf you would like to suggest changes to the existing presets or new presets for other specs or situations, please do so to [feedback]. \r\n[h3]Why doesn\'t the preset limit the items to X, Y, and Z?[/h3]\r\nThe weight presets are for sorting; filters are for limiting the search results. If you want to restrict the items you see, use the appropriate tool - the filter options. The only limit applied by the weight scales is that it will not display items with a score of 0 or less. You should continue to use the existing filtering system if you want to see items of a specific type, slot, source, speed, etc.\r\n[h3]Why does it suggest the gems it does for the sockets?[/h3]\r\nThe suggested gems are based on your weights. If you would like to see a different gem in the sockets, try increasing the weight of the appropriate stat. If you feel the weights in the presets need to be adjusted, please let us know at [feedback].\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[/tabs]',NULL),(-13,2,0,'[menu tab=2 path=2,13,2]\r\n\r\nWe thrive on user contributions!

It should showcase the main object, but take into account the details around it. The same 7 elements of art design come into play here, Line, Shape, Form, Space, Texture, Light & Color. We\'ll touch on several of these and how to make use of the in game settings and mechanics to enhance your pictures.\r\n\r\nTurn your resolution and color sampling as high as your computer can handle. Turn on all the image effects and details, but turn down the weather effects to the lowest setting. In general you want all your glow and spell effects maxed to really show the environment to its fullest potential (they actually help with the lighting too!) You may find a shot that you need to play with these settings to enhance, sometimes turning down environmental detail is helpful to remove extra grasses.\r\n\r\nWorld of Warcraft actually has an internal setting for screenshot quality, and by default that quality is set to [b]3/10[/b].  You can turn this up, though, in order to take higher quality screenshots.  In order to do so, type this command into your chatbox:\r\n\r\n[code]/console screenshotQuality 10[/code]\r\n\r\nMost of the time taking the pictures from 1st person view works best, so zoom all the way in so that you\'re looking through your character\'s eyes. Occasionally the object might be too big (large NPCs especially) to use this view - if this is the case get as close to them as you can without having your body in the shot and swing the camera around to get the angle that you\'re looking for.\r\n\r\nPay attention to the light - a well lit picture is 10 times better than a dark one. You may even want to do a little color correcting before uploading - increase the brightness and contrast a touch. For instance - it\'s a lot easier to take pictures in sunny Stormwind than deep in the mountains of torch lit Ironforge. Daytime pictures also turn out better than night.\r\n\r\n[h3]Featuring Armor[/h3]\r\n\r\n[screenshot url=STATIC_URL/images/help/screenshots/armor.jpg thumb=STATIC_URL/images/help/screenshots/armor2.jpg float=right]Dreamwalker Spaulders[/screenshot]We want to see the armor! Not Joe Schmoe in the armor. In general you want close ups of the piece itself (except for full set pictures). Don\'t be afraid to submit a 4 inch picture of one glove. Once\'s it\'s cropped and loaded and shrunk down to the thumbnail it will look great!\r\n\r\nUse your best judgment when cropping armor pics, but remember - we want to see details of the armor - not the person or a far away image. Of course, this also applies to weapons or any other piece of equipment!\r\n\r\n[h3]Featuring NPCs[/h3]\r\n\r\n[screenshot url=STATIC_URL/images/help/screenshots/npc.jpg thumb=STATIC_URL/images/help/screenshots/npc2.jpg float=right]Cairne Bloodhoof <High Chieftain>[/screenshot]Full body shots should be the norm. If you can\'t get a good full shot (e.g. they\'re standing behind a counter) get the waist up shot. There\'s no need to include the on-screen text and titles of NPCs. The website already lists those, so just get in close and take a great shot of the NPC itself.\r\n\r\nGet down on their level - you may need to \"/sit\" or even \"/sleep\" to get a good view of something low to the ground (scorpions, boots, spiders, etc.)\r\n\r\nWhen capturing moving NPCs, try to get as much a head on front shot as you can, being willing to take a few hits while you take picture of a mob attacking you can make for a great shot.

Each of the sections are broken down in detail below.\r\n[h3]Basic Profile Information[/h3]\r\nAt the top of a profile you will see an expanded header with vital information about the profile itself. All profiles have an icon and the character\'s race, class and level; Armory characters display a link to the character\'s guild under the name, while custom profiles display a description set by the user that created it. A link to [b]Edit[/b] this information appears on the bottom line, allowing you to update a profile you created or make a new custom profile from an existing one.\r\n\r\n[ul]\r\n[li][img src=STATIC_URL/images/help/profiler/edit.gif float=right][b]Name [/b]– Give your profile a name!

Private ones will not be displayed or visible to others.[/li]\r\n[/ul]\r\n[i]Note: If you edit a character in any way, it will become a custom profile. The reputations, achievements, and raid progress information will be removed.[/i]\r\n\r\n[h3]Managing Profiles[/h3]\r\nIn the upper right are a number of useful buttons for managing profiles without having to go back to your user page. Each of the buttons have several options that can be used to manage the character\'s page you are currently on and include the following options.\r\n\r\n[ul]\r\n[li][b]Custom Profile[/b]\r\n[ul][li][b]New[/b] – This is a quick link to creating a new, blank profile from scratch.

Your private profiles will not be visible to anyone else.\r\n\r\n[i]Tip: When you are logged in, all of your characters and custom profiles can be accessed from the [b]My profiles[/b] menu at the top right of any page![/i][pad]\r\n[h3]Saving Your Work[/h3]\r\nAny profile can be edited, even if you don\'t own it, but you\'ll probably want to save your work when you\'re done! You must have an account with us in order to save a profile. Once you\'ve created an account, you can bookmark any number of Armory characters and save up to 10 custom profiles. Premium users will be able to create even more, so upgrade if 10 just isn\'t enough! You can use the red buttons to save a profile from its page, and manage your existing profiles and characters from your user page. \r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab name=\"Inventory and talents\"]\r\n[img src=STATIC_URL/images/help/profiler/character.jpg height=300 float=right]The main tab for a profile is the character inventory, which includes a lot of the same information you would see by looking at your character pane in game. This tab is broken up into four key sections - the character view, quick facts box, statistics, and gear summary.\r\n\r\n[h3]Character View[/h3]\r\nThe first thing you\'ll notice, of course, is your character – as rendered by our custom built modelviewer, in all it\'s three-dimensional glory. You can turn the character with your mouse, and zoom in and out using the A and Z keys, just like the modelviewer elsewhere in the site.  [b]We even pull your face, hair, and skin color information from the Armory![/b]\r\n\r\nOn either side of the character are inventory icons which you can right click on for a menu of options:\r\n\r\n[i]Tip: You can remove a gem or enchant by clicking None in the picker window or by right clicking on it in the gear summary.[/i]\r\n\r\n[ul]\r\n[li][img src=STATIC_URL/images/help/profiler/itemmenu.gif float=right][b]Equip... / Replace...[/b] – Selecting this option will give you a quick search box in which you can type an item\'s name. Click on the item or hit return to equip it.\r\nUnequip – Unequips the item, of course. :)[/li]\r\n[li][b]Add / Replace enchant...[/b] – The spell icon on the left shows if the item is enchanted. This opens a customized picker window with all enchants available for the item slot.[/li]\r\n[li][b]Add / Replace gem...[/b] – The icon on the left shows the socket color or socketed gem. Like the enchants, this opens a picker window with valid gems for the socket.[/li]\r\n[li][b]Extra socket[/b] – The check mark on the left indicates if a blacksmithing socket has been added to this item. Click to toggle on or off.[/li]\r\n[li][b]Clear Enhancements[/b] - This will remove all reforges, enchantments, gems and extra sockets from an item. Useful if you want to start fresh with an item.[/li]\r\n[li][b]Display on character[/b] – The checkmark on the left indicates if the item is displayed on the  model. Click to toggle on or off – it works for more than just cloaks and helms![/li]\r\n[li][b]Compare[/b] – Adds the item to the [url=/?compare]item comparison tool[/url] and opens it in a new window to compare with other items.[/li]\r\n[li][b]Find upgrades[/b] – Uses our [url=/?help=stat-weighting]weighted search[/url] to find upgrades based on your talent spec.[/li]\r\n[li][b]Who wears this?[/b] – Creates a filtered list of other Armory characters who are also wearing the item.[/li]\r\n[/ul]\r\n\r\n[i]Tip: Items that can take enchantments but have no enchantment, or which have empty sockets, will even have a little notification in the tooltip![/i]\r\n\r\n[img src=STATIC_URL/images/help/profiler/quickfacts.gif float=right][h3]Quick Facts Box[/h3]\r\nOn the right hand side is a handy Quick Facts box that displays basic, defining information about a profile. This box is chock full of useful information, including talent spec, achievement points, and professions.\r\n\r\n[i]Tip: Any raid icon that\'s ringed in [color=c4]gold[/color] is a raid that the character has cleared![/i]\r\n[h3]Statistics[/h3]\r\nYou\'ll also notice that all of a profile\'s statistics are laid out beneath the character view. This is also all information you can get from the Armory (and then some), but we lay it out in a nice, convenient page so you can view it all at once – no more messing with drop down menus. You can also click on a statistic and expand it so you can see its tooltip information right there on the page—or click on the header to expand all the related statistics. Your statistics are updated as you edit any part of a profile, including race, class, level, items, enhancements, or talents – all in real time! [b]Statistic modifications from glyphs and buffs are not presently supported, but will be in the future.[/b]\r\n\r\n[i]Note: These statistics are calculated manually – they are not pulled from the Armory. Statistics calculations are still in beta and will ironed out as we go.[/i]\r\n\r\n[img src=STATIC_URL/images/help/profiler/statistics.gif float=center]\r\n\r\n[h3]Gear Summary[/h3]\r\n[div float=right align=right][img src=STATIC_URL/images/help/profiler/gearsummary.gif]\r\n[small]A warning message is displayed for missing enhancements.[/small][/div]Last on the character inventory tab, but not least, is the gear summary. This is a personalized list of all items worn by the character, with convenient column headers and in line filtering options. Use it to see where most of a character\'s items come from, what is the best and worst piece, and whether or not there are missing gems and enchants. Just in case the empty icons aren\'t clear enough, a warning appears at the top of the list if a character is missing gems, enchants, or blacksmith sockets. This [color=q10]warning[/color] is based on the professions of the character if it is an Armory profile, and otherwise shows you everything missing on custom profiles.\r\n\r\nThe gems and enchants can also be edited from within the gear summary, and have a few additional options not available in the character view. You can remove or replace an enhancement from here, and you can find upgrades using our [url=/?help=stat-weighting]weighted search[/url] – just like items!\r\n\r\n[h3]Talents[/h3]\r\nThe talents tab includes an inline version of our [url=/?talent]talent calculator[/url] with a full display of a character\'s talents. It is locked by default, but you can unlock it to begin editing talents, just as you would normally. There are two extra features in the Profiler\'s talent calculator: you can store and swap between two specs for each character, and export the current talent build to the calculator to link to your friends. When you change your talents (or swap between specs) your gear score and statistics will be updates real time!\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab name=\"Other tabs\"]\r\n\r\n[h3]Reputation[/h3]\r\nThe reputation tab displays the complete faction information of an Armory character, with collapsible headers for each section. Its much easier to read than the tiny faction pane in game! Of course, you can link directly to the faction\'s page to get more information about that faction. \r\n[h3][img src=STATIC_URL/images/help/profiler/achievements.gif float=right]Achievements[/h3]\r\nThe achievements tab lists an Armory character\'s progress in each of the main achievement categories, and has a filterable list of achievements including date completed. All of the normal column and list filters are available, along with some new ones! You can filter the list by earned, in progress or complete achievements – complete are displayed by default – or click on any of the category progress bars to only display achievements from that category.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab name=Completion_Tracker]\r\n\r\n[img src=STATIC_URL/images/help/profiler/quests.jpg float=right width=450]You can use the Profiler\'s [b]Completion Tracker[/b] feature to keep track of your quests, achievements, pets, mounts, recipes, and more!\r\n\r\n[h3]Getting Started[/h3]\r\n\r\nIn order to start tracking your completion data, all you need to do is visit your character\'s page on the profiler and resync it. This will automatically collect data about your character\'s completed achievements, companion pets, mounts, quests, recipes, reputations and titles.\r\n\r\n[h3][img src=STATIC_URL/images/help/profiler/completion.jpg float=right]Tracking Your Completion Data[/h3]\r\n\r\nOnce you\'ve got your data up on the site, it will be available in the form of five new tabs: [b]mounts[/b], [b]companions[/b], [b]recipes[/b], [b]quests[/b], and [b]titles[/b].\r\n\r\nIf you open the mounts, companions, or titles tabs, you\'ll immediately be greeted by a list of all the entries you\'ve already completed.  You can cycle through the different tabs to see the ones you already have, the ones you still have yet to collect, a complete list, or a list of just the ones you\'ve \"excluded\" (more on that shortly).  You can also use the \"Search within results\" box to search the list based on a keyword, just like you can with other search results in the database.\r\n\r\nThe recipe, and quest tabs, like the Achievements tab, contain more entries—so you\'ll be presented with a box like the one shown above.  From there, all you have to do is click one of the progress bars to see the complete tabbed list in each category.\r\n\r\n[h3]Exclusions[/h3]\r\n\r\nWhen you\'re trying to make sure we check off every quest, achievement, or mount on our list, everyone knows that there are some that you just don\'t want to bother with.  To that end, we\'ve created [b]exclusions[/b].\r\n\r\n[img src=STATIC_URL/images/help/profiler/exclusions.jpg float=right]Using exclusions, you can flag certain quests, mounts, achievements, recipes, pets, or titles that \"don\'t count\" toward your completion total.  When you exclude (for example) a quest, that quest no longer appears in \"incomplete\" listings, and the total number of quests in that category is reduced by one.\r\n\r\n[b]For example:[/b] There are 632 quests in the \"Eastern Kingdoms\" category. If I were to decide that [quest=367] is for noobs and I don\'t want to count it, then all I have to do is put a check in the box next to the quest and click \"Exclude\".  After I do so, the Eastern Kingdoms progress bar will only show [i]631[/i] quests total—the remaining quest will appear in the \"Excluded\" tab but won\'t be counted for anything else.\r\n\r\nIf you want to re-include a quest, just go to the \"Excluded\" tab and then use the checkboxes to restore as many as you like.  You can do the same thing for achievements, titles, mounts, pets, or recipes.\r\n\r\nIf you [b]complete[/b] a quest that you have excluded, it will show in the progress bar as a [b]+1[/b].  Example: If there are 31 quests in the \"Miscellaneous\" category, and I\'ve completed 20 quests and excluded 1, the progress bar will show [b]20/30[/b].  If I have completed [i]the quest that I excluded[/i], then the progress bar will show [b]20(+1)/30[/b].  If I then go on to complete ALL the quests in that category (including the one I excluded), the progress bar will show [b]30(+1)/30[/b].\r\n\r\n[b]Exclusion Manager[/b]\r\nThe companions and mounts tabs let you manage your exclusions en masse with the Exclusion Manager.  Just click the \"Manage Exclusions\" button on top of the tabs to see a list of convenient categories you might want to exclude.  There\'s also a \"reset all\" button here to let you wipe all of your exclusions and start over.\r\n\r\n[b]Note:[/b] The Exclusion Manager is currently only available for companions and mounts.\r\n\r\n[i]Tip: Exclusions are tied to your account, not to a particular character.  This is so even when you look at someone else\'s character, you\'re judging them by [/i]your[i] completion standards, not anyone else\'s![/i] \r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab name=Calculations]\r\n\r\nMost of the information we display is pretty straightforward. A lot of it, particularly the stats on items, is readily available in our database and on various tooltips. There are some new numbers on profile pages that you may ask, what does this number mean? How was it calculated?\r\n[h3]Base Statistics[/h3]\r\nA character\'s five base statistics are determined primarily by his or her class and level. This base amount has a modifier applied to it depending on the character\'s race. We gathered an extensive amount of data from the armory to come up with these base numbers, using untalented individuals of every race, class, and level combination. Because racial modifiers are consistent, we are able to create statistics for \"fake\" race and class combos using the data we already know. However, the Armory does not give data on characters below level 10 or Death Knights below level 55, so we have no statistic information for these profiles. To simplify things, we have set a minimum level for custom profiles based on the available statistics.\r\n[h3]Gear Score[/h3]\r\nOkay, so a lot of sites have gear scores. Most of them (ours included) are based around the [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Item_level]item budget[/url] Blizzard uses to determine how much of each stat can be on an item. This budget is calculated using the item\'s level, quality, and slot, and we use the budget as the item\'s gear score. You can view a complete breakdown of an item\'s gear score by mousing over it in the [url=/?help=profiler#profiler-inventory-and-talents]gear summary[/url] at the bottom of the character tab. You can view a breakdown of a profile\'s total gear score by mousing over it in the Quick Facts box, also on the character tab.\r\n\r\nEach gear score is color coded based on the item levels of the gear in reference to the character level. [b][color=q0]Grey[/color][/b] for poor, [b][color=q1]White[/color][/b] for common, [b][color=q2]Green[/color][/b] for uncommon, [b][color=q3]Blue[/color][/b] for rare, [b][color=q4]Purple[/color][/b] for epic and [b][color=q5]Orange[/color][/b] for legendary. For example, a level 70 character wearing high item-level, raiding epics from [zone=3606] and [zone=3959] will have a purple-colored gearscore, as their items are considerably \"epic\" quality for their level. However, the same character at 80, if wearing this same gear,  will have the gearscore colored blue as the items are of lower-than-optimal quality for their level.\r\n\r\nThe value of an empty socket was generated using the gear score of appropriate gems for the item in question, and subtracted from the item\'s score. This allows us to score unsocketed items lower than an item without sockets of the same level, quality, and slot. Items with better than expected gems will receive higher scores, and items with lower quality gems (or no gems at all) will receive lower scores.\r\n\r\nThe values of enchants are based off of the level of the enchantment.  Endgame enchantments are 20 points, profession perks are 40 points, etc.  The numbers go down from there.\r\n\r\nYou may notice that some profiles have different gear scores for the same item. There is an extreme difference in budget between a two-handed or one-handed weapon, which causes a discrepancy in scores between characters who should be fairly equal according to the level of their gear. To address this, the gear score of weapons has been normalized so that a character with appropriate weapon choices has the equivalent score of two two-handed weapons. Appropriate weapons are determined by your class and spec; for example, an enhancement shaman should dual wield one handed weapons, a protection warrior should have a one-hander and shield, etc. For classes which the melee weapons don\'t really matter – like hunters or spellcasters – anything they can use is considered appropriate.\r\n\r\n[i]Note: Gear score does not take into account the stats of the item. It is a measurement of quality of gear, not whether the stats on the gear are suited to the character\'s spec.[/i]\r\n\r\n[h3]Guild Scores[/h3]\r\nGuild gear scores and achievement points are derived using a weighted average of all of the known characters in that guild. Guilds with at least 25 level 80 players receive full benefit of the top 25 characters\' gear scores, while guilds with at least 10 level 80 characters receive a slight penalty, at least 1 level 80 a moderate penalty, and no level 80 characters a severe penalty. This is to prevent small guilds and bank alts from appearing to have higher scores than legitimate raiding guilds. Instead of being based on level, achievement point averages are based around 1,500 points, but the same penalties apply.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[/tabs]',NULL),(8,577,0,'[minibox]\n[h2]Steamwheedle Cartel[/h2]\n[faction=21]\n[faction=577]\n[faction=369]\n[b]Everlook[/b]\n[/minibox]\n\n[b]Everlook[/b], the faction of the town Everlook, is a trading post is run by the goblins of the Steamwheedle Cartel.

It is run by goblins as a trading post and is officially neutral to all races and factions. Even so, pilgrims allowed to venture up to the World Tree stop here, but otherwise this is the highest that merchants and explorers may venture without the night elves’ permission. Everlook would offer a commanding view of Kalimdor, if it were not at such a high altitude that clouds constantly shroud the mountain’s lower flanks.\n\nEverlook is the only major goblin outpost in northern Kalimdor, and it serves several purposes. First, it serves as the base of operations for goblin thorium and arcanite miners since Winterspring has some of the few untapped veins of those materials on the continent. Second, it serves as a center of trade between the Alliance and the Horde. While Everlook is hardly as safe as Moonglade, generally the Alliance and the Horde treat each other fairly well there. Additionally, Everlook is a frequent stop-off and resupply point for the faithful who make the pilgrimage through Winterspring to Hyjal Summit.\n\n[h3]Reputation[/h3]\nReputation for Everlook and the Steamwheedle Cartel is mostly gained from quests in Winterspring.

The Convocation of Silvermoon (also known as \"The Silvermoon Council\"), the ruling body of the high elves was also based here. Across a stretch of ocean to the north is the island that contains the Sunwell.[pad]Although Silvermoon itself was left relatively unscathed from the second war, in the third war the Death Knight Arthas led the Scourge into the city, attacking it on his quest to reach the Sunwell. The High Elven King was slain and the majority of the population killed. Scourge forces held the city for a time but abandoned it after the depleting of its resources.[pad]Though the city was attacked by the Scourge, it is not as destroyed as one might think. Though many of its plants are dead, and the occasional dead body is sprawled across the cobblestone, the city was immune to the fire and destruction. Silvermoon now resembles a ghost town, intact, but eerily abandoned.

Much like the Circle, it is a coalition of night elf and tauren forces. Since the opening of the Dark Portal, the Cenarion Expedition has quickly gained in size and autonomy, achieving enough power to be considered its own faction. The Expedition maintains its primary base at Cenarion Refuge in [zone=3521]; it has also made its presence known on [zone=3483], in [zone=3519], and in the [zone=3522]. Cenarion Refuge is located immediately west of Thornfang Hill.\n\nThe Refuge is located in the Zangarmarsh for the primary reason of studying the rich wildlife located there. However, the Expedition has discovered troubling goings-on in the marsh. Water levels in many parts of Zangarmarsh are decreasing, and some areas such as the Dead Mire have already suffered greatly from this strange phenomenon. It has become known that this decrease in the water levels can be attributed to pumps that have been constructed in the Marsh by the naga. Their purpose is to create a new Well of Eternity for [npc=22917]. However, the Expedition cannot afford direct confrontation with the naga so numerous in the Zangarmarsh and [url=?search=coilfang#c0z]Coilfang Reservoir[/url]. It needs the aid of those willing to assist the druids in their dangerous battle against those who seek to disturb the marsh\'s natural balance. Quite naturally, those heroic enough to fight the naga at Coilfang Reservoir will be well rewarded.\n\n[h3]Reputation[/h3]\n[b]Neutral to Honored[/b]\nKill Naga, while also running [zone=3717] whenever you can; a good instance run will net reputation faster than soloing. Alternatively, the player can begin turning in [item=24401] for a chance at an [item=24407], which can be turned in for 500 reputation.
